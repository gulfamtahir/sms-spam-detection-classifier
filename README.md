# sms-spam-detection-classifier
Created Email/Spam Classifier using Kaggle Dataset and carefully did the Data Preprocessing , EDA and use the Naive Bayes and Random Forest Classifier for the Detection of SPAM email/sms

Choose the dataset from the Kaggl https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/sms-spam-collection-a-more-diverse-dataset

Model choose for this classifier is the Naive Bayes and The Random Forest because I have trained multiple classifiers but these two gave me the best Accuracy and the Precision with less false Positive Values
